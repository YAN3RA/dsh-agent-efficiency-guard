/**
 * Host-face Typert contribution for the `capabilityPolicy` namespace.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the claim set of `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-gateway` is built
 * once and then frozen. `claimsEndpoint()` decides whether an
 * `/api/<namespace>/<method>` request belongs to the gateway:
 *
 *     claimsEndpoint(endpoint) {
 *       if (this.ctx.typert.local.get(endpoint) !== void 0 || …hasSeen(endpoint)) return true
 *       this.srcClaims ??= this.collectSrcClaims()   // ← built once, never refreshed
 *       return this.srcClaims.has(endpoint)
 *     }
 *
 * `collectSrcClaims()` only sees the services that were already visible in
 * `ctx.reflect.props` at the moment of that first evaluation, and the snapshot is
 * only dropped again by an `internal/service` event. A host that starts serving
 * the browser before this package's gateway has registered therefore freezes a
 * claim set without `capabilityPolicy` — and then every 能力菜单 call falls
 * through to the default answer, which the browser reports as
 * `transport failure for /api/capabilityPolicy/…: HTTP 404`. The official
 * desktop application hits that ordering: `dsh-desktop-host` hands the window
 * its authenticated URL as soon as the profile is ready, and the renderer fires
 * `/api/session/…` immediately.
 *
 * `ctx.typert.register()` is the documented path for contributions that do not
 * ship a generated `./typert` artifact (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-typert-loader`: *"Manual
 * `ctx.typert.register()` remains available for contributions that do not use a
 * `./typert` artifact"*). Registering the namespace here puts every endpoint into
 * the **local** store, which `claimsEndpoint()` consults dynamically — so
 * whether the panel can reach the host stops depending on who won the startup
 * race.
 *
 * The wire metadata mirrors the browser face in `src/client/remote.ts`; keep the
 * two tables in step (`tests/host-face.spec.ts` fails when they drift). The
 * codecs are deliberately pass-through: the gateway decodes arguments with
 * `codec.create().parse(value)` and encodes a strict result with
 * `codec.encode?.(value) ?? value`, while the real argument and result types are
 * already enforced by the method signatures in `src/server/remote.ts`.
